This primary data is supplemented with information from international organizations such as the International Monetary Fund and United Nations, while secondary sources including academic studies, think-tank analyses, and media reports are used for verification and gap-filling (Tian & Lopes da Silva, 2023). SIPRI maintains a standardized methodology to ensure consistency and comparability across different countries, focusing specifically on expenditures directly related to armed forces and defense activities (Smith & Tian, 2023).\nDespite SIPRI’s rigorous methodology, the data collection process faces several significant challenges that affect its reliability (Freeman & Fleurant, 2022). Key limitations include variations in how different countries define military expenditure, inconsistent reporting practices across nations, and limited transparency in certain governments’ defense budgets (Tian et al., 2024). For instance, some countries include paramilitary forces and military pensions in their calculations while others exclude them, and data from conflict-affected regions often proves incomplete or outdated. While SIPRI addresses these challenges through its standardized methodology and cross-referencing of multiple sources, researchers should remain mindful of these inherent limitations when analyzing the data, particularly for countries with opaque or classified defense budgets (Perlo-Freeman & Wezeman, 2021)."

Conflict or instable states tend to spend more on defense compared to economic slowdowns or perceived reduced threats, which would lead to spending cuts.

This essentially reverses a post-Cold War trend of reduced defense spending that implied reduced global conflict and tension. In the most recent years, however, it has been drawing back to stabilize probably due to economic restraints and different geopolitical priorities.\n\n\nCode\n# Filter data for North American countries and calculate the average expenditure per year (constant)\nnorth_america_spending_constant &lt;- country_spending_years %&gt;%\n  filter(ISO3 %in% north_america_countries) %&gt;%\n  group_by(Year) %&gt;%\n  summarize(TotalExpenditure = mean(Expenditure, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\")\n\n# Improved Plot for North America (Constant Expenditure)\nggplot(north_america_spending_constant, aes(x = Year, y = TotalExpenditure)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"darkred\", size = 1.2) +  # Dark red line for North America\n  labs(\n    title = \"Total Military Expenditure of North American Countries (Constant 2022 USD)\",\n    subtitle = \"The total constant military expenditure (inflation-adjusted) across North American countries (1949-2023)\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Average Military Expenditure (Billion USD)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 12, hjust = 0.5),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 8, hjust = 0.5),\n    legend.position = \"none\",  # No legend needed\n    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = \"gray80\", size = 0.5),  # Subtle grid lines for clarity\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),  # No minor grid lines\n    axis.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 12),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 8)\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma)  # Format y-axis with commas for clarity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe chart above provides the trend in total military spending with some key highlights from 1949 that there is a dip in the post-Cold War period and a sudden rise in spending. Long run trends have always shown a greater concern toward defense capabilities. The total of military spending can be seen reducing after the Cold War as global tensions eased and the threat of major conflicts diminished. But in the recent years, military expenditure is seen on a high pace, for the obvious rise of terrorism and geopolitical instability within the globe, leading a security threats.\nThe initial rise in military expenditure during the Cold War most likely has to do with the two leading countries in the arms race, which desperately invested in their military build-up: the United States and the Soviet Union. The subsequent post-Cold War reduction is finally a shift towards lesser tension and, generally, less overall perceived threat of large-scale conflict. The most recent increase is due to mounting concerns over terrorism, regional conflicts, and shifts in global power dynamics. More particular analysis, especially at the level of individual countries, and closer look of how military spending correlates with economic growth, political stability, and geopolitical events would explain more understanding of these trends.\n\n\n5.1.2 Europe\n\n\nCode\n# List of European countries (ISO3 codes for reference)\neurope_countries &lt;- c(\n  \"ALB\", \"AND\", \"ARM\", \"AUT\", \"AZE\", \"BEL\", \"BIH\", \"BGR\", \"HRV\", \"CYP\", \"CZE\", \n  \"DNK\", \"EST\", \"FIN\", \"FRA\", \"GEO\", \"DEU\", \"GRC\", \"HUN\", \"ISL\", \"IRL\", \"ITA\", \n  \"KOS\", \"LVA\", \"LTU\", \"LUX\", \"MKD\", \"MDA\", \"MLT\", \"MNE\", \"NLD\", \"NOR\", \"POL\", \n  \"PRT\", \"ROU\", \"RUS\", \"SMR\", \"SVK\", \"SVN\", \"ESP\", \"SWE\", \"CHE\", \"TUR\", \"UKR\", \"GBR\"\n)\n\n# Filter data for European countries and calculate the average expenditure per year (constant)\neurope_spending_constant &lt;- country_spending_years %&gt;%\n  filter(ISO3 %in% europe_countries) %&gt;%\n  group_by(Year) %&gt;%\n  summarize(TotalExpenditure = mean(Expenditure, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\")\n\n# Improved Plot for Europe (Constant Expenditure)\nggplot(europe_spending_constant, aes(x = Year, y = TotalExpenditure)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"darkblue\", size = 1.2) +  # Dark blue line for Europe\n  labs(\n    title = \"Total Military Expenditure of European Countries (Constant 2022 USD)\",\n    subtitle = \"The total constant military expenditure (inflation-adjusted) across European countries\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Average Military Expenditure (Billion USD)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 12, hjust = 0.5),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 9, hjust = 0.5),\n    legend.position = \"none\",  # No legend needed\n    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = \"gray80\", size = 0.5),  # Subtle grid lines for clarity\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),  # No minor grid lines\n    axis.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 12),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 10)\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma)  # Format y-axis with commas for clarity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graph above is that of the total military expenditure of European countries (in billions of constant 2022 USD), fluctuating up and down for the period 1949–2023 with years of significant growth eventually followed by years of relative decline or stagnation; paralell to varied geopolitics and economics. A quick increase in military spending at the beginning of the 1950s relates to the peaking Cold War tension, as the European nations arm themselves against the Soviet Union. For the entire Cold War period. Expenditures on the arms race and the Eastern Bloc were debated intensely, reflecting the era’s occuring anxieties.\nWith the end of the Cold War in the early 1990s, Europe cut back military spending since the Soviet Union was dissolved and the immediate threat to Western Europe disappeared. However, in recent years, European military expenditure has again been noticeable. The rise of the growing tension between the two old adversaries, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and apprehensions of disorder in the world have been drivers of this change. These changes in expenditure illustrate how different economic factors, perceptions of vulnerability, and issues in a wider world-work together to shape expenditure. For example, future work might want to look at individual events and their effects on budgets or compare how spending patterns differ within EU states.\nThe peak of military expenditure that is noteworthy around 1989 is likely as a result of the last few years of the Cold War when both NATO and Warsaw Pact, along with the Soviet Union, had been heavily investing in their military capabilities. Indeed, it can be noted that this period had some very significant arms races and high defense expenditure by the two superpowers, the USA and the Soviet Union. Hence, the peak in 1989 fits because it is also the period of military buildup just before the dissolution of the Soviet Union, and even after that event, Russia, its successor state, continued another five years of very high defense spending.\n\n5.1.2.1 Closer Look to Europe as a Total Spending\n\n\nCode\n# List of European countries and their ISO3 codes\ncountry_names &lt;- c(\n  \"ALB\" = \"Albania\", \"AND\" = \"Andorra\", \"ARM\" = \"Armenia\", \"AUT\" = \"Austria\", \n  \"AZE\" = \"Azerbaijan\", \"BEL\" = \"Belgium\", \"BIH\" = \"Bosnia and Herzegovina\", \"BGR\" = \"Bulgaria\", \n  \"HRV\" = \"Croatia\", \"CYP\" = \"Cyprus\", \"CZE\" = \"Czech Republic\", \"DNK\" = \"Denmark\", \n  \"EST\" = \"Estonia\", \"FIN\" = \"Finland\", \"FRA\" = \"France\", \"GEO\" = \"Georgia\", \"DEU\" = \"Germany\", \n  \"GRC\" = \"Greece\", \"HUN\" = \"Hungary\", \"ISL\" = \"Iceland\", \"IRL\" = \"Ireland\", \"ITA\" = \"Italy\", \n  \"KOS\" = \"Kosovo\", \"LVA\" = \"Latvia\", \"LTU\" = \"Lithuania\", \"LUX\" = \"Luxembourg\", \"MKD\" = \"North Macedonia\", \n  \"MDA\" = \"Moldova\", \"MLT\" = \"Malta\", \"MNE\" = \"Montenegro\", \"NLD\" = \"Netherlands\", \"NOR\" = \"Norway\", \n  \"POL\" = \"Poland\", \"PRT\" = \"Portugal\", \"ROU\" = \"Romania\", \"RUS\" = \"Russia\", \"SMR\" = \"San Marino\", \n  \"SVK\" = \"Slovakia\", \"SVN\" = \"Slovenia\", \"ESP\" = \"Spain\", \"SWE\" = \"Sweden\", \"CHE\" = \"Switzerland\", \n  \"TUR\" = \"Turkey\", \"UKR\" = \"Ukraine\", \"GBR\" = \"United Kingdom\"\n)\n\n# Filter data for European countries and calculate the total expenditure per year\neurope_spending_constant &lt;- country_spending_years %&gt;%\n  filter(ISO3 %in% europe_countries) %&gt;%\n  group_by(Year, ISO3) %&gt;%\n  summarize(TotalExpenditure = sum(Expenditure, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\")\n\n# Find the top 3 countries with the highest total military expenditure\ntop_countries &lt;- europe_spending_constant %&gt;%\n  group_by(ISO3) %&gt;%\n  summarize(TotalExpenditure = sum(TotalExpenditure), .groups = \"drop\") %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(TotalExpenditure)) %&gt;%\n  slice_head(n = 3) %&gt;%\n  pull(ISO3)\n\n# Create a new category \"Others\" for all other countries\neurope_spending_constant &lt;- europe_spending_constant %&gt;%\n  mutate(ISO3 = ifelse(ISO3 %in% top_countries, ISO3, \"Others\"))\n\n# Calculate the total expenditure for \"Others\"\neurope_spending_constant &lt;- europe_spending_constant %&gt;%\n  group_by(Year, ISO3) %&gt;%\n  summarize(TotalExpenditure = sum(TotalExpenditure, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\")\n\n# Update the country names for the top 3 countries\ntop_country_names &lt;- country_names[top_countries]\n\n# Improved Plot for Europe (Constant Expenditure)\nggplot(europe_spending_constant, aes(x = Year, y = TotalExpenditure, fill = ISO3)) +\n  geom_area(alpha = 0.8, size = 0.3, color = \"black\") +  #

Fundamentally, this is because, for the first time, the Russian military expenditure was included in the total European figure. When Russia was part of the Soviet Union, until its disintegration in 1991, significant military expenditure by it meant a big contribution to the overall European total. With Russia becoming an independent country, aggregate European expenditure no longer includes its spending, and, therefore, there was an easily perceivable drop in the total figure.\n\n\nCode\n# Filter data for European countries and calculate the average expenditure per year (percentage of government spending)\neurope_spending_percentage &lt;- country_spending_years_percentage %&gt;%\n  filter(ISO3 %in% europe_countries) %&gt;%\n  group_by(Year) %&gt;%\n  summarize(AverageExpenditure = mean(Expenditure, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\")\n\n# Improved Plot for Europe (Expenditure as Percentage)\nggplot(europe_spending_percentage, aes(x = Year, y = AverageExpenditure)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"darkblue\", size = 1.2) +  # Purple line for Europe\n  labs(\n    title = \"Average Military Expenditure of European Countries as a Percentage of Government Spending\",\n    subtitle = \"The average military expenditure as a percentage of government spending across European countries\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Average Military Expenditure (%)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 10, hjust = 0.5),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 8, hjust = 0.5),\n    legend.position = \"none\",  # No legend needed\n    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = \"gray80\", size = 0.5),  # Subtle grid lines for clarity\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),  # No minor grid lines\n    axis.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 10),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 10)\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(scale = 1))  # Format y-axis as percentage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the graph above “Average Military Expenditure of European Countries as a Percentage of Government Spending,” it basically shows how there has been an overall upward trend in military expenditure as a share of government budgets over the period 2014 to 2023. This is how European countries have changed their priorities amidst dynamic changes in security threats and other geopolitics. Although there is not a clear trend downward over time, from this graph it also becomes clear that there are substantial year-on-year fluctuations in military spending, some years it goes up quite sharply. The standard deviation of these changes is, however, rather huge since the showing tendency is that military spending depends on how pressured individual European countries feel regarding specific risks, and even wider political and economic conditions at any given time.\nOne of the most obcious peak in military expenditure as a share of government spending took place immediately before and in the year 2023. Though not explicitly expressed, such surge likely resulted from various recent geopolitical developments which is the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The conflict, to which fears for regional security spread by Europe gave great note, prompted a number of its countries to increase their defense mechanisms. The increase in military expenditure is thus directed at responding to what is perceived as a greater operational events of external threats against which a reallocation of resources to defense priorities by governments is called for. It may also include other factors such as cyber threats, and a instability in the neighborhood. Economy also matters, as during periods of economic boom there is buoyancy with increased spending; hence, during economic slumps resources tend to be subtracted from most sectors including defense.\n\n\nCode\n# Calculate the country with the highest military expenditure as a percentage for each year\ntop_country_percentage &lt;- country_spending_years_percentage %&gt;%\n  filter(ISO3 %in% europe_countries) %&gt;%\n  group_by(Year, ISO3) %&gt;%\n  summarize(TotalExpenditure = sum(Expenditure, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\") %&gt;%\n  group_by(Year) %&gt;%\n  top_n(1, TotalExpenditure) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\n# Add country names for the top countries\ntop_country_percentage &lt;- top_country_percentage %&gt;%\n  mutate(Country = country_names[ISO3])\n\n# Display the top countries for each year\ntop_country_percentage %&gt;%\n  select(Year, Country, TotalExpenditure)\n\n\n\n\n5.1.2.2 Closer Look to Europe as a Percentage of Spending\n\n\nCode\ntop_country_percentage &lt;- top_country_percentage %&gt;%\n  arrange(Year)\n\n# Plot the graph with adjusted colors and smaller text\nggplot(top_country_percentage, aes(x = Year, y = TotalExpenditure, group = 1, color = Country)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1.2) +  # Line graph with thicker lines\n  geom_point(size = 3) +   # Add points for visibility\n  scale_color_manual(values = RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(12, \"Set3\")[1:length(unique(top_country_percentage$Country))]) +  # Use Set3 for up to 12 colors\n  labs(\n    title = \"Military Expenditure as Percentage of Government Spending\",\n    subtitle = \"Combined line graph showing top countries over the years\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Military Expenditure (%)\",\n    color = \"Country\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 10) +  # Reduced base size for smaller text\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5, size = 14),  # Reduced title size\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10, hjust = 0.5),  # Reduced subtitle size\n    axis.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 10),  # Reduced axis title size\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 8),  # Reduced axis text size\n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\n    legend.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 8),\n    legend.text = element_text(size = 8)  # Reduced legend text size\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(scale = 1)) +  # Format y-axis as percentage\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    breaks = seq(min(top_country_percentage$Year), max(top_country_percentage$Year), by = 2)  # Adjust year breaks\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBreakup of the Soviet Union: The dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 led to significant geopolitical shifts and conflicts in the region, particularly in the Caucasus and the Balkans.

North Macedonia’s aspiration to join NATO could drive increased military spending to meet alliance standards.\nGeopolitical Factors: Cyprus’s strategic location in the Eastern Mediterranean has made it a point of interest for various regional and global powers. The country’s alignment with Western powers and its potential role in regional security have also influenced its military spending decisions.\n\n\n\n5.1.3 Middle East\n\n\nCode\n# Data preparation\ncountry_spending_years &lt;- data_long_constant %&gt;%\n  mutate(ISO3 = countrycode(Country, origin = \"country.name\", destination = \"iso3c\"))\n\n# List of Middle Eastern countries (ISO3 codes for reference)\nmiddle_east_countries &lt;- c(\n  \"ARE\", \"AFG\", \"BHR\", \"IRN\", \"IRQ\", \"ISR\", \"JOR\", \"KWT\", \"LBN\", \"OMN\", \"PAK\", \n  \"QAT\", \"SAU\", \"SYR\", \"TUR\", \"YEM\"\n)\n\n# Filter data for Middle Eastern countries\nmiddle_east_spending &lt;- country_spending_years %&gt;%\n  filter(ISO3 %in% middle_east_countries) %&gt;%\n  group_by(Year) %&gt;%\n  summarize(TotalExpenditure = sum(Expenditure, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\")\n\n# Improved Plot\nggplot(middle_east_spending, aes(x = Year, y = TotalExpenditure)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"darkgreen\", size = 1.2) +  # Thicker line with a contrasting color\n  labs(\n    title = \"Total Military Expenditure of Middle Eastern Countries (1949–2023)\",\n    subtitle = \"Total military expenditure in Middle Eastern countries over time\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Total Military Expenditure (Billion USD)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 14, hjust = 0.5),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10, hjust = 0.5),\n    legend.position = \"none\",  # No legend needed\n    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = \"gray80\", size = 0.5),  # Subtle grid lines\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),  # No minor grid lines\n    axis.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 12),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 10)\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma)  # Format y-axis with commas for better readability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis graph “Total Military Expenditure of Middle Eastern Countries (1949-2023).” It shows that for the majority of Middle Eastern countries military spending has significantly risen, especially since the 1970s. The increase in expenditure is massive as it reflects the increasing defense priorities of Middle Eastern countries. While the general trend is an increasing one, there are periods of fluctuation-such as a sharp dip in the early 1990s that most likely derives from geopolitical realignment in the region. However, there came about an upturn in military spending at the close of the 1990s and the beginning of the 2000s as conflict spread across the region and thereby demand for increased military action.\nThere are lot of complex geopolitical dynamics within the region make the Middle East one of the factors. Regional conflicts, internal instability, and several interventions create such a situation that military expenditure keeps mounting. rivalries, especially that between Iran and Saudi Arabia, fuels an arms race, with defense expenditure rising exponentially. The factor has also played a critical role in the region, given the massive reserves of oil in countries such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which can provide the money required to sustain large defense budgets. The new security threats, among them being terrorism after 9/11 besides extreme groups, have installed even more pressure and therefore militaries invest more resources in countering the challenges.\n\n\nCode\n# Filter data for Middle Eastern countries and calculate the average expenditure per year\nmiddle_east_spending &lt;- country_spending_years_percentage %&gt;%\n  filter(ISO3 %in% middle_east_countries) %&gt;%\n  group_by(Year) %&gt;%\n  summarize(TotalExpenditure = mean(Expenditure, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\")\n\n# Improved Plot\nggplot(middle_east_spending, aes(x = Year, y = TotalExpenditure)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"darkgreen\", size = 1.2) +  # Thicker line with a deeper color for contrast\n  labs(\n    title = \"Average Military Expenditure of Middle Eastern Countries (1988–2023)\",\n    subtitle = \"The average percentage of GDP spent on military across Middle Eastern countries\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Average Military Expenditure (Percentage)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 12, hjust = 0.5),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 8, hjust = 0.5),\n    legend.position = \"none\",  # No legend needed\n    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = \"gray80\", size = 0.5),  # Subtle grid lines for clarity\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),  # No minor grid lines\n    axis.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 12),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 10)\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(scale = 1))  # Format y-axis as percentage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis grapgh for Middle Eastern countries’ average military expenditures as a percentage of GDP between 1988 and 2023 indicates a slower downward trend, their economies spending less on the military. Fluctuations, however, are significant. One such major rise was noticed, particularly in the early 1990s. This was later followed by years of decline. The most recent years have seen a relatively marginal increase in military expenditure as a percentage of GDP, perhaps reflection of changed security priorities.\nSeveral factors are likely to explain these trends. The Middle East geopolitical dynamics, where there is a lot of conflict in the region, instability, and external interventions, would make defense spending priorities fluctuate. Such reasons could have been responsible for the increase in the early 1990s, as well as the aftermath of the war in the Gulf. Economic factors also play critical roles. During times of economic boom, many Middle Eastern states increase resources for defense; however, during a depression, there would be reduced military expenditure. Finally, more concern about threats, like terrorism and regional instability by the government, may change their priorities with military spending.\n\n\n5.1.4 Asia\n\n\nCode\nasia_countries &lt;- c(\n  \"AFG\", \"ARM\", \"AZE\", \"BHR\", \"BGD\", \"BRN\", \"BTN\", \"KHM\", \"CHN\", \"CYP\", \n  \"IND\", \"IDN\", \"IRN\", \"IRQ\", \"ISR\", \"JPN\", \"JOR\", \"KAZ\", \"KOR\", \"KWT\", \n  \"KGZ\", \"LAO\", \"LBN\", \"MYS\", \"MDV\", \"MNG\", \"MMR\", \"NPL\", \"OMN\", \"PAK\", \n  \"PHL\", \"QAT\", \"SAU\", \"SGP\", \"LKA\", \"SYR\", \"TJK\", \"THA\", \"TKM\", \"ARE\", \n  \"UZB\", \"VNM\", \"YEM\"\n)\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Filter data for Asian countries and calculate the total expenditure per year (absolute spending)\nasia_spending_total &lt;- country_spending_years %&gt;%\n  filter(ISO3 %in% asia_countries) %&gt;%\n  group_by(Year) %&gt;%\n  summarize(TotalExpenditure = sum(Expenditure, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\")\n\n# Improved Plot for Asia (Total Expenditure)\nggplot(asia_spending_total, aes(x = Year, y = TotalExpenditure)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"darkorange\", size = 1.2) +  # Dark orange line for total spending\n  labs(\n    title = \"Total Military Expenditure of Asian Countries\",\n    subtitle = \"Total military expenditure across Asian countries over time\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Total Military Expenditure (Billion USD)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 14, hjust = 0.5),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10, hjust = 0.5),\n    legend.position = \"none\",  # No legend needed\n    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = \"gray80\", size = 0.5),  # Subtle grid lines for clarity\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),  # No minor grid lines\n    axis.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 12),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 10)\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma_format())  # Format y-axis with commas for thousands\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis graph “Total Military Expenditure of Asian Countries” shows a significant upward trend in military spending across the region from 1950 to 2023. This steady increase in military expenditure reflects growing defense budgets, particularly since the late 1990s and early 2000s, although there are periods of fluctuation, such as a noticeable dip in the early 1990s.\nSome factors probably explain this trend. Geopolitical movements after the end of the Cold War, China becoming a major world power, and other regional conflicts such as that in the South China Sea are the most important drivers of what is happening to military spending in the region. The financial resources to support larger military budgets are a consequence of the economic growth in several Asian countries, especially China and India. The increased need for defense expenditures in the region provides part of the overall surge in military spending as the perception of threats, be it terrorism, cyberspace, or regional instability evolves.\n\n\nCode\n# Filter data for Asian countries and calculate the average expenditure per year (percentage of government spending)\nasia_spending_percentage &lt;- country_spending_years_percentage %&gt;%\n  filter(ISO3 %in% asia_countries) %&gt;%\n  group_by(Year) %&gt;%\n  summarize(AverageExpenditure = mean(Expenditure, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\")\n\n# Improved Plot for Asia (Expenditure as Percentage)\nggplot(asia_spending_percentage, aes(x = Year, y = AverageExpenditure)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"darkorange\", size = 1.2) +  # Dark orange line for Asia\n  labs(\n    title = \"Average Military Expenditure of Asian Countries as a Percentage of Government Spending\",\n    subtitle = \"The average military expenditure as a percentage of government spending across Asian countries\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Average Military Expenditure (%)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 10, hjust = 0.5),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 8, hjust = 0.5),\n    legend.position = \"none\",  # No legend needed\n    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = \"gray80\", size = 0.5),  # Subtle grid lines for clarity\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),  # No minor grid lines\n    axis.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 10),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 10)\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(scale = 1))  # Format y-axis as percentage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graph “Average Military Expenditure of Asian Countries as a Percentage of Government Spending” reveals a general downward trend in military spending from the early 1990s to around 2010. During this period, the percentage of government spending allocated to the military decreased. However, there were significant fluctuations, with a sharp increase in the early 1990s followed by a period of decline. More recently, there has been a slight uptick in military expenditure as a percentage of government spending, which may reflect evolving security concerns in the region.\nThe discrepancy between increasing total military expenditure and decreasing the percentage that military spending accounts for in government budgets can be explained by the broader trend of economic growth in Asia. While the likes of China and India have raised their total defense budgets substantially due to such aspects as geopolitics and perceived threats, the size of their overall government budgets has increased at an even faster rate. This has been primarily due to robust economic performance which has enabled governments to channel big resources into many other sectors such as infrastructure, education, and health, hence reducing the share of military expenditure in total government expenditure. Hence, even as total military spending is on the rise, it is squeezing into a smaller share of the public sector pie."

Russia increased its military expenditure sharply from the year 2021, reflecting increased military activities by the country. Ukraine increased its defense expenditure significantly since 2014 when the conflict began to counter Russia’s acts of aggression. Thereby, it pulled along other NATO members like Poland, Romania, and the Baltic states which had already been on a military budget increase spree due to heightened security sensitivities. Leading West European nations, including lower increments for collective defense from countries like France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, show higher investments in other directions of their choice.\nThe main factors behind these trends are the rise of geopolitical tensions, the extent to which NATO is an important factor in cultivating defense readiness, and economic and domestic political considerations that shape budgetary decisions. In the future, the relationships between such variables as military spending and such indicators as GDP growth and political stability will be important for understanding larger global trends. The future, in turn, will be contingent on how the Ukraine crisis plays out and broader international developments. On the whole, this data speaks to how much regional conflicts can bear directly on defense spending in Europe, and thus how important it is to keep a close eye on such shifts if one hopes to have a handle on the continent’s changing security environment.\nOverall, the graph highlights the significant impact of the conflict in Ukraine on military spending in the region. It underscores the importance of monitoring these trends to understand the evolving security landscape in Europe and beyond.\n\n\nCode\n# Visualization for GDP Percentage with Improved Colors\nggplot(conflict_summary, aes(x = Year, y = GDPPercentage, color = ISO3, group = ISO3)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1.2) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    values = c(\n      \"UKR\" = \"#1f78b4\", \"RUS\" = \"#e31a1c\", \"DEU\" = \"#33a02c\",\n      \"FRA\" = \"#ff7f00\", \"BEL\" = \"#6a3d9a\", \"POL\" = \"#b15928\",\n      \"ROU\" = \"#b2df8a\", \"BGR\" = \"#fb9a99\", \"LVA\" = \"#fdbf6f\",\n      \"LTU\" = \"#cab2d6\", \"EST\" = \"#a6cee3\"\n    )\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Military Spending as a Percentage of GDP (Conflict-Related Countries)\",\n    subtitle = \"Spending as a share of GDP for Ukraine, Russia, and key NATO members since 2014\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Military Spending (% of GDP)\",\n    color = \"Country\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 14, hjust = 0.5),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10, hjust = 0.5),\n    axis.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 12),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 10),\n    legend.title = element_text(face = \"bold\"),\n    legend.text = element_text(size = 10),\n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\n    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = \"gray80\", size = 0.5),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(scale = 1), limits = c(0, max(conflict_summary$GDPPercentage) * 1.1)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2014, 2023, 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsidering the analysis of military spending as a percentage of GDP, there are indeed remarkable trends within conflict-related countries. In particular, the military expenditure in Ukraine relative to GDP has soared dramatically since 2014, to register the nation’s intensified efforts toward countering Russian aggression. For Russia, it keeps the level of military spending share of GDP fairly steady, thereby sustaining the focus on military readiness. From 2021, NATO member countries especially near Russia are already responding to the significant security concerns by raising defense spending as a share of GDP. Western European countries, most notably France, Germany, and the UK, have slow growth in military spending at their relatively lower levels.\nThe main drivers of these trends are increased geopolitical tensions, the influence of NATO in stimulating collective defense, and the economic ability of individual nations to support larger allocations for defense. National political considerations concerning public opinion and electoral cycles also have a bearing on the formation of spending priorities within the defense sector. More importantly, the data reflects the enormous responses of the Ukraine conflict on regional military expenditures, revealing changed priorities in response to different threats. Keeping track of such developments is important in comprehending wider security dynamics in Europe, as well as the global reverberations of these shifts."

During the Cold War (1949-1991), spending rose sharply as the United States and Soviet Union engaged in an arms race, driving global defense budgets upward. This period saw military expenditure peak, reflecting heightened tensions and the prioritization of defense capabilities. After the Cold War ended, a marked decline occurred as nations shifted focus to economic development and reduced perceived threats. Temporary spikes, such as during the Gulf War (1990-1991), reflect increased spending due to regional conflicts and peacekeeping operations.\nIn more recent years, another uprising in spending has taken place, fueled by factors such as changes to NATO’s strategic postures and mounting geopolitical challenges. This has placed more emphasis on deterrence and defense in light of newer threats, such as terrorism plus cyber warfare, and regional instability. Even though the chart captures the dynamics at work on a global level, it fails to provide the kind of fine-grained details one would want on individual countries, or to capture non-military security spending. Still, on the whole, it gives us a sense of how military expenditure responds to periods of major conflict, economic drivers, or changes in the international relations"

There was a surge of expenditure in the years immediately following the September 11, 2001 attacks mainly to support military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. As one would expect, there was also an earlier peak of military expenditure during the years of the Cold War as the perceived Soviet threat increased. In fact, once the Cold War was over, military spending started to fall. It has again picked up in recent years which could also be understood in terms of emerging global threats and escalating geopolitics, as well as advancements in military technology. Such swings serve to underline the sensitivity of changes in U.S defense outlays to changes in global geopolitics.\n\n\nCode\n# Annotated Line Chart for US Military Spending as a Percentage of GDP\nus_data_percentage &lt;- data_long_spend %&gt;% filter(Country == \"USA\")\n\nggplot(us_data_percentage, aes(x = Year, y = Expenditure)) +\n  # Main line for expenditure as percentage of GDP\n  geom_line(color = \"blue\", size = 1.2) +\n  # Highlight 2001 with a red point\n  geom_point(\n    data = us_data_percentage %&gt;% filter(Year == 2001), \n    aes(x = Year, y = Expenditure), \n    color = \"red\", size = 4\n  ) +\n  # Add text annotation with an arrow pointing to the highlighted year\n  annotate(\n    \"text\",\n    x = 2005, y = 4.5,\n    label = \"Post-9/11 Surge\",\n    color = \"red\",\n    size = 4, fontface = \"bold\"\n  ) +\n  annotate(\n    \"segment\",\n    x = 2001, xend = 2001,\n    y = us_data_percentage$Expenditure[us_data_percentage$Year == 2001] - 0.2, \n    yend = us_data_percentage$Expenditure[us_data_percentage$Year == 2001], \n    arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.2, \"cm\")), \n    color = \"red\", size = 0.8\n  ) +\n  # Improved labels and title\n  labs(\n    title = \"US Military Expenditure as a Percentage of GDP Over Time\",\n    subtitle = \"Significant surge observed following the 9/11 attacks in 2001\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Military Expenditure (% of GDP)\"\n  ) +\n  # Enhanced theme for aesthetics\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 14, hjust = 0.5),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10, hjust = 0.5),\n    axis.title = element_text(face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = \"gray80\", size = 0.5),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  ) +\n  # Scale the y-axis to add some padding above the highest point\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, max(us_data_percentage$Expenditure) + 0.5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere was a very sharp increase in the US military expenditure as a percentage of GDP subsequent to the 9/11 attacks including the military operation in Afghanistan and Iraq but because of the limitation in data begins in 2001 we dont see it. Since that point, however, there has been some erosion in spending on the military relative to the size of the economy. This is indicative of a change in priority and a plateauing of concerns on security issues. Over the period of growing economy at large, the proportionate rise in military spending has not taken place. It contains shifts in domestic and international priorities, constraints of the economy having other competing demands for funds, more strategic defense, and changed global politics post-Cold War influencing American decision on budget in this area."

The US consistently accounts for the majority of NATO’s total military expenditure, raising discussions about burden-sharing among alliance members.\n\nThe US contributes approximately 70% of NATO’s total defense spending, highlighting its dominant role in funding and maintaining alliance military capabilities.\nSeveral NATO allies, particularly in Europe, fall below the 2% GDP defense spending guideline agreed upon by NATO members.\nThis imbalance became especially prominent during the 2014 Crimea crisis, where the US called for greater European military investment.\n\n\n\nCode\n# Define a list of NATO member countries\nnato_countries &lt;- c(\n  \"USA\", \"Canada\", \"UK\", \"France\", \"Germany\", \n  \"Italy\", \"Belgium\", \"Netherlands\", \"Luxembourg\", \"Norway\", \n  \"Denmark\", \"Portugal\", \"Turkey\", \"Greece\", \"Spain\", \n  \"Poland\", \"Hungary\", \"Czech Republic\", \"Bulgaria\", \"Romania\", \n  \"Slovakia\", \"Slovenia\", \"Estonia\", \"Latvia\", \"Lithuania\", \n  \"Croatia\", \"Albania\", \"Montenegro\", \"North Macedonia\"\n)\n\n# Filter the dataset for NATO countries\nnato_data &lt;- data_long_constant %&gt;% filter(Country %in% nato_countries)\n\n# Summarize data for US and other NATO members\nnato_summary &lt;- nato_data %&gt;%\n  mutate(US_Expenditure = ifelse(Country == \"USA\", Expenditure, 0),\n         Other_NATO_Expenditure = ifelse(Country != \"USA\", Expenditure\n                                         , 0)) %&gt;%\n  group_by(Year) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    US_Expenditure = sum(US_Expenditure, na.rm = TRUE),\n    Other_NATO_Expenditure = sum(Other_NATO_Expenditure, na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n\n# Pivot data for visualization\nnato_summary_long &lt;- nato_summary %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(US_Expenditure, Other_NATO_Expenditure), names_to = \"Category\", values_to = \"Expenditure\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Visualization: US vs NATO Military Expenditure\nggplot(nato_summary_long, aes(x = Year, y = Expenditure, fill = Category)) +\n  # Use geom_area for a stacked area chart\n  geom_area(alpha = 0.8, color = \"black\", size = 0.3) + \n  # Customize fill colors\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    values = c(\"US_Expenditure\" = \"#1f78b4\", \"Other_NATO_Expenditure\" = \"#b2b2b2\"),\n    labels = c(\"Other NATO Expenditure\", \"US Expenditure\") # Swap labels\n  ) +\n  # Add labels and title\n  labs(\n    title = \"US vs. NATO Military Expenditure (1949–2023)\",\n    subtitle = \"A comparison of military expenditure between the US and other NATO members\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Military Expenditure (USD Billions)\",\n    fill = \"Expenditure Type\"\n  ) +\n  # Enhance theme for better visualization\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 14, hjust = 0.5),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10, hjust = 0.5),\n    axis.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 12),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 10),\n    legend.position = \"bottom\",  # Move legend to the bottom for a cleaner layout\n    legend.title = element_text(face = \"bold\"),\n    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = \"gray80\", size = 0.5),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  ) +\n  # Adjust y-axis for better spacing\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma_format()) +\n  # Add some padding for aesthetics\n  scale_x_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.02)))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Calculate the percentage of US expenditure relative to NATO total\nnato_percentage &lt;- nato_summary_long %&gt;%\n  group_by(Year) %&gt;%\n  summarize(\n    US_Expenditure = sum(Expenditure[Category == \"US_Expenditure\"], na.rm = TRUE),\n    NATO_Total = sum(Expenditure, na.rm = TRUE)\n  ) %&gt;%\n  mutate(US_Percentage = (US_Expenditure / NATO_Total) * 100)\n\n# Plot the percentage of US expenditure over the years\nggplot(nato_percentage, aes(x = Year, y = US_Percentage)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"blue\", size = 1.2) +\n  geom_point(size = 1, color = \"red\", alpha = 0.8) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"US Military Expenditure as a Percentage of NATO Total (1949–2023)\",\n    subtitle = \"Percentage of US military expenditure relative to the total NATO expenditure over time\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Percentage (%)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 14, hjust = 0.5),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10, hjust = 0.5),\n    axis.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 12),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = \"gray80\", size = 0.5),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(scale = 1)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.02)))"

    "text": "7.2 Discussion and Interpretation of Findings\nThe proportional relationship between the United States and military expenditure is one of the most important facts about international security since the middle of the 20th century when NATO began, and the U.S. was by far the biggest spender on collective defense throughout this period (Beckley, 2018). During this time, the United States covered around 70% - 80% of all NATO expenses for defense, a very unequal cost sharing that conveys just how much of America’s military resources are at the disposition of its allies in the alliance. Such a financial imbalance becomes particularly mentioned in moments of significant geopolitical tension, be it during the years of the Cold War, in the post-9/11 world, or most recently, with increased tensions from Russia following its aggression in Ukraine.\nThese regional trends indicate a far more complex set of regional dynamics than what is happening in the more traditional NATO area. The Asia-Pacific region has seen a significant increase in military spending with the rise of China’s economy and its rapid modernization of the military, and strategic investments by India in defense capabilities. In many cases, the Middle East shows a special pattern of rather unique military spending, a behavior induced by either oil revenues or common persistent conflicts within regions. This has repeatedly brought more significant gdp per capita defense budgets in countries, especially Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, where sophisticated security challenges reflect the specificity of the region.\nFor European countries, there is a specific fragility of their defense posture, with many having underinvested historically, and therefore being overly reliant on the United States for military support (Mölling & Brune, 2022). Several NATO members have persistently failed to reach the alliance’s target defense expenditure of 2% of GDP, such as Germany, which only recently started to increase military expenditure significantly. The Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 laid extremely bare these strategic weaknesses and has since prompted a rethink on European defense capacity with initiatives such as the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) that seeks to up collective military preparedness."
